## About

Daylight is a Minecraft Forge mod that serves as a precise and flexible visual indicator of current game time. 

Time management is one of many problems survival players face. Not knowing the precise time of day makes it difficult to do your daily tasks. The clock item was introduced to mitigate this problem, however its design leaves much to be desired.  This is where Daylight swoops in to save the day! 

Once installed Daylight will be visible in the corner of your screen (configurable) from where it will continually inform you on what time of day it is with seamless and graceful animation.

With the power of Daylight you are guaranteed to always be one step ahead of time!
