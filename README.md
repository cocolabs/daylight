# Daylight

Are you tired of guessing what time of the day it is? You don't have resources to make a clock or it's not precise enough for you? Were you ever killed by mobs seconds away from your make-shift house and dropped all your mined goods because your time estimation was slightly off?  Well, your dog days are over.

Team Yoco proudly presents you our mod Daylight. Located in the upper right corner of your screen (configurable) Daylight is a precise indicator of the current time in the game. With graceful animation that displays solar and lunar changes you will always know when to come out of your man cave.

Daylight will make your playing experience much better knowing you don't have to think about time. It's size and frame is delicate so you will not even notice it's presence. Just joking...you will cause it's awesome! In matter of fact, it's better then wolfs...I mean clocks! All you have to do is visit Curse Forge and have fun!
