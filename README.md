## About

Time management continues to be a persistent problem survival players face. This problem can be addressed in two ways: periodically checking the position of the sun or crafting a clock item. Both of these solutions require continuous physical effort on behalf of players to stay informed, and the former is not possible from locations where sun remains out of visible reach.
Daylight is a Minecraft Forge mod that serves as a precise and flexible visual indicator of current game time. 

We believe this to be unneeded effort that only detracts from game experience, and this is where Daylight swoops in to save the day! Once installed Daylight will be visible in the top right corner of your screen (position is configurable) from where it will inform you on what time of day it is with seamless and graceful animation displaying solar and lunar changes. 

With the power of Daylight you are guaranteed to always be one step ahead of time!
